Description: Go implementation of the Ed25519 signature algorithm
 Ed25519 is a public-key signature system based on elliptic-curve
 cryptography, carefully engineered at several levels of design and
 implementation to achieve very high speeds without compromising security.
 .
 This package contains the NebulousLabs fork of the original Go implementation
 (see https://github.com/agl/ed25519 and the golang-ed25519-dev package).
